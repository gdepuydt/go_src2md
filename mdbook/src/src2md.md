# src2md.go
## This is the Go programming language source code for src2md
This is the program that I wrote that generated this actual webpage yopu are looking at right now.
It basically extracts all comments that are in the Go source codes and puts evrything in a Markdown file.
Indeed, the comments use Markdown for laying out the text

```go
{{#include ../../src2md.go:9:112}}

```
Write text to Markdown file

```go
{{#include ../../src2md.go:114:119}}

```
Create a new file, removing the file thatalready exists. all text will be appended upon writing.

```go
{{#include ../../src2md.go:121:130}}

```
 TODO: do the defer destructor function here to correctly close the opened file

```go
{{#include ../../src2md.go:132:135}}

```
